/* The word final used in the definition of object variables catches attention.

The result of this word is that the values of these object variables cannot be

e.g. increase the amount of money, we must create a new object to represent 
that new amount of money. */

members of the referred object can be changed. final for non-primitive variables
just means that they cannot be changed to refer to any other object. */
