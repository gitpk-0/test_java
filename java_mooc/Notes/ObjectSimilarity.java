// Methods to Test for Equality - "equals"

/*The equals method checks by default whether the object given as a parameter
  has the same reference as the object it is being compared to. In other words,
  the default behaviour checks whether the two objects are the same. If the
  reference is the same, the method returns true, and false otherwise. */

// The books are the same
// The books aren't the same

/*The internal structure of the book objects (i.e., the values of their instance
variables ) in the previous example is the same, but only the first comparison
prints "The books are the same". This is because the references are the same in
the first case, i.e., the object is compared to itself. The second comparison
is about two different entities, even though the variables have the same
values.

For strings, equals works as expected in that it declares two strings identical
in content to be 'equal' even if they are two separate objects. The String
class has replaced the default equals with its own implementation.

If we want to compare our own classes using the equals method, then it must be
defined inside the class. The method created accepts an Object-type reference
as a parameter, which can be any object. The comparison first looks at the
references. This is followed by checking the parameter object's type with the
instanceof operation - if the object type does not match the type of our class,
the object cannot be the same. We then create a version of the object that is
of the same type as our class, after which the object variables are compared
against each other.*/

/*This reliance on default methods such as equals is actually the reason why Java
demands that variables added to ArrayList and HashMap are of reference type.
Each reference type variable comes with default methods, such as equals, which
means that you don't need to change the internal implementation of the
ArrayList class when adding variables of different types. Primitive variables
do not have such default methods.*/

// Appoximate Comparison with HashMap

/*In addition to equals, the hashCode method can also be used for approximate
comparison of objects. The method creates from the object a "hash code", i.e, a
number, that tells a bit about the object's content. If two objects have the
same hash value, they may be equal. On the other hand, if two objects have
different hash values, they are certainly unequal.

Hash codes are used in HashMaps, for instance. HashMap's internal behavior is
based on the fact that key-value pairs are stored in an array of lists based on
the key's hash value. Each array index points to a list. The hash value
identifies the array index, whereby the list located at the array index is
traversed. The value associated with the key will be returned if, and only if,
the exact same value is found in the list (equality comparison is done using
the equals method). This way, the search only needs to consider a fraction of
the keys stored in the hash map.

So far, we've only used String and Integer-type objects as HashMap keys, which
have conveniently had ready-made hashCode methods implemented. Let's create an
example where this is not the case: we'll continue with the books and keep
track of the books that are on loan. We'll implement the book keeping with a
HashMap. The key is the book and the value attached to the book is a string
that tells the borrower's name:*/

HashMap<Book, String> borrowers = new HashMap<>();

Book bookObject = new Book("Book Object", 2000, "...");
borrowers.put(bookObject, "Pekka");
borrowers.put(new Book("Test Driven Development", 1999, "..."), "Arto");

System.out.println(borrowers.get(bookObject));
System.out.println(borrowers.get(new Book("Book Object", 2000, "...")));
System.out.println(borrowers.get(new Book("Test Driven Development", 1999, "...")));
Sample output
Pekka
null
null

/*We find the borrower when searching for the same object that was given as a key
to the hash map's put method. However, when searching by the exact same book
but with a different object, a borrower isn't found, and we get the null
reference instead. The reason lies in the default implementation of the
hashCode method in the Object class. The default implementation creates a
hashCode value based on the object's reference, which means that books having
the same content that are nonetheless different objects get different results
from the hashCode method. As such, the object is not being searched for in the
right place.

For the HashMap to work in the way we want it to, that is, to return the
borrower when given an object with the correct content (not necessarily the
same object as the original key), the class that the key belongs to must
overwrite the hashCode method in addition to the equals method. The method must
be overwritten so that it gives the same numerical result for all objects with
the same content. Also, some objects with different contents may get the same
result from the hashCode method. However, with the HashMap's performance in
mind, it is essential that objects with different contents get the same hash
value as rarely as possible.

We've previously used String objects as HashMap keys, so we can deduce that the
String class has a well-functioning hashCode implementation of its own. We'll
delegate, i.e., transfer the computational responsibility to the String object.
*/

public int hashCode() {
    return this.name.hashCode();
}

/*The above solution is quite good. However, if name is null, we see a
NullPointerException error. Let's fix this by defining a condition: if the
value of the name variable is null, we'll return the year of publication as the
hash value.
*/

public int hashCode() {
    if (this.name == null) {
        return this.published;
    }

    return this.name.hashCode();

improve it further so that the year of publication is also taken into account
in the hash value calculation that's based on the book title.*/

        return this.published;
    }

    return this.published + this.name.hashCode();

faced earlier gets solved and the book borrowers are found:*/

// Sample output
// Pekka
// Pekka
// Arto

/*Let's review the ideas once more: for a class to be used as a HashMap's key, we
need to define for it:

-the equals method, so that all equal or approximately equal objects cause the
 comparison to return true and all false for all the rest

-the hashCode method, so that as few objects as possible end up with the same
 hash value*/

/*Assisted creation of the equals method and hashCode

NetBeans provides support for the creation of both equals and hashCode. You can
select Source -> Insert Code from the menu and then select equals() and
hashCode() from the drop-down list. NetBeans then asks for the instance
variables used in the methods. The methods developed by NetBeans are typically
sufficient for our needs.

Use NetBeans's support in creating the equals and hashCode methods until you
know that your methods are better than those created automatically by
NetBeans.*/
